Below is the list of projects contained within this repo that I worked on, as well as what they implement.

### Random Quote Generator ###
 - Uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as a smidge of jQuery.
 - Implements Twitter 'intents' feature to push the current quote into the text box so a user can easily tweet it.
 - Simple fade technique utilizing setTimeout() and toggling classes.
 - Styling the quote box : alignment was done with flexbox for the actual box, and position absolute for the elements inside.
