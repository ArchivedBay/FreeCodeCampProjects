# FreeCodeCampProjects
Core projects completed while going through free code camp
# Project overview #
Below is the list of projects contained within this repo that I worked on, as well as what they implement.

### Random Quote Generator ###
 - Uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as a smidge of jQuery.
 - Implements Twitter 'intents' feature to push the current quote into the text box so a user can easily tweet it.
 - Simple fade technique utilizing setTimeout() and toggling classes.
 - Styling the quote box : alignment was done with flexbox for the actual box, and position absolute for the elements inside.
 
 ### Weather Forecast Display ###
 - Uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery
 - Implements FreeCodeCamp's weather API and HTML5's Geolocation to get your location and display the current weather/temp
 - Background & animation changes depending on the weather
 - I used a hosting service to host the images since codepen does not play nicely with imgur links, so it is a bit slow since       it has to grab those images from the server.
